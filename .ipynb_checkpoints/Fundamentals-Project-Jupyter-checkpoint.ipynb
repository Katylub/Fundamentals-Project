    "\n",
    "One waiter recorded information about each tip he received over a period of two and a half month working in one restaurant in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was one of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law the restaurant offered seating in a non-smoking sections to patrons who requested it. The data\n",
    "was assigned to those days and during those times when the food server was routinely assigned to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips Dataset contains a dataframe with 244 obervations on 8 variables, that allow hospitality managers understand the factors that influence their business, incuding size of the party, smoking preferences, table size, among others.\n",
